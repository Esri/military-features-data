# military-features-data

The ArcGIS Defense and Intelligence Military Features Data repository is a set of data and test applications for use in ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Runtime. This data is used to create features for planning, operations and intelligence domains based on military symbology specifications such as MIL-STD-2525C and APP-6(B).

## Features

* This is the source data for the ArcGIS Defense and Intelligence military feature templates. This data is used to create features and derived data products using military symbology. 
* Provides data files that let you create command and control (C2) operational features based on military symbology specifications MIL-STD-2525C/D and APP-6(B) in ArcGIS Desktop
* Provides project/layer packages that include the database schema and sample data for military features
* Provides symbology style files for displaying and creating military symbology in ArcGIS Desktop
* Provides additional derived data products for use in ArcGIS Runtime
* See each version of the standard for more information:
    * [US MIL-STD-2525D "Delta" - mil2525d](./data/mil2525d)
	* [US MIL-STD-2525C "Charlie" - mil2525c](./data/mil2525c)
    * [NATO APP-6(B) - app6b](./data/app6b)
	* Important Note: MIL-STD-2525D is the current and actively maintained version. Other older standard versions are provided for legacy purposes.

### Using the Source Data

* Download the repository
* Determine the version of the military symbology standard you are using:
    * [US MIL-STD-2525D "Delta" - mil2525d](./data/mil2525d)
	* [US MIL-STD-2525C "Charlie" - mil2525c](./data/mil2525c)
    * [NATO APP-6(B) - app6b](./data/app6b)
* If using the source data with ArcGIS Desktop...
    * Update the local ArcGIS Military Style Files to the latest versions from the repository.
        * IMPORTANT NOTE: This is **required** if you are using a version of ArcGIS Desktop **prior to 10.3**
        * Navigate to the folders
            *  [military-features-data\data\mil2525d\stylefiles](./data/mil2525d/stylefiles)
            *  [military-features-data\data\mil2525c\stylefiles](./data/mil2525c/stylefiles)
			*  [military-features-data\data\app6b\stylefiles](./data/app6b/stylefiles)
        * Update/copy all of the .style files from each folder into your ArcGIS Desktop Style folder (overwrite if necessary - you may want to create a backup of these files before this step)
        * For example, copy the style files from above location into this Desktop Folder: `{ArcGIS Install Location}\ArcGIS\Desktop10.X\Styles`
    * Create symbology using the ArcGIS Style Manager or open the provided layer packages to create military features
* If using the source data with ArcGIS Runtime or ArcGIS Professional...
    * Update the local ArcGIS symbol dictionary files with the versions from the repository.
    * Navigate to the appropriate (to the version desired) folder in this repository:
        *  [military-features-data\data\mil2525d\core_data\stylxfiles](./data/mil2525d/core_data/stylxfiles)
        *  [military-features-data\data\mil2525c\stylxfiles](./data/mil2525c/stylxfiles)
        *  [military-features-data\data\app6b\stylxfiles](./data/app6b/stylxfiles)
    * Update/copy the files from each folder into your local resource folder. E.g.
	    * ArcGIS Professional: `Pro\Resources\Dictionaries\mil2525d`
		* ArcGIS Runtime: `arcgisruntimeX.X.X\resources`
		* Overwrite if necessary (but you may want to create a backup of these files before this step)

### Running the ArcGIS Runtime Test Applications

* There are several sample/test applications provided for the standalone test/verification/validation of this data.
* For more information, see the instructions in the [test](./test) folder.
